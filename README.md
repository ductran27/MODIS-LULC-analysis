# MODIS Global Land Cover Change Analysis

Analysis system for tracking land use and land cover (LULC) changes using NASA MODIS data. Monitors deforestation, urbanization, agricultural expansion, and ecosystem transitions across multiple years.

## Overview

This project analyzes MODIS Land Cover Type product (MCD12Q1) to quantify and visualize land cover changes over time. The system processes annual global land cover maps to detect transitions between vegetation types, urban expansion, and environmental changes.

## Data Source

NASA MODIS Land Cover Type Product (MCD12Q1):
- Annual global land cover maps at 500m resolution
- 17 land cover classes (IGBP classification)
- Available from 2001 to present
- Public domain data from NASA EOSDIS

## Analysis Components

### 1. Area Coverage Analysis
- Calculate area of each land cover class globally/regionally
- Track forest, cropland, urban, wetland coverage
- Generate statistics for each land cover type

### 2. Multi-Year Comparison
- Compare land cover between different years
- Identify major changes (deforestation, urbanization)
- Quantify transitions between classes

### 3. Change Detection
- Detect land cover transitions (forest to cropland, etc.)
- Calculate change rates over time
- Identify hotspots of change

### 4. Global Visualization
- Create global land cover maps for each year
- Show spatial distribution of different classes
- Highlight areas of significant change

## Land Cover Classes

IGBP Classification includes:
- Evergreen Needleleaf Forest
- Evergreen Broadleaf Forest
- Deciduous Needleleaf Forest
- Deciduous Broadleaf Forest
- Mixed Forests
- Closed Shrublands
- Open Shrublands
- Woody Savannas
- Savannas
- Grasslands
- Permanent Wetlands
- Croplands
- Urban and Built-up
- Cropland/Natural Vegetation Mosaic
- Snow and Ice
- Barren
- Water Bodies

## Output

Generated analysis:
- Annual area statistics by land cover class
- Change matrices showing transitions
- Time series of land cover trends
- Global maps showing spatial patterns
- Change detection maps highlighting transitions

## Applications

Used for:
- Deforestation monitoring
- Urban expansion tracking
- Agricultural land change
- Wetland conservation
- Climate change impacts on vegetation
- Ecosystem health assessment

## Notes

This is an analytical project for understanding global environmental changes. Unlike the daily monitoring projects, this analyzes annual trends and multi-year patterns in land use and land cover.
